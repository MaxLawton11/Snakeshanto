This was a project for a compsci class in high school. This is a snake game that I made out of my teacher (his name is Proshanto and he likes mountain dew). It is a website and can be run from the index.html file without any additional installs. <br>
(note: It says reloaded because the game was originally made in Python, but I remade it in Javascript)

i got a 130% in the class overall
